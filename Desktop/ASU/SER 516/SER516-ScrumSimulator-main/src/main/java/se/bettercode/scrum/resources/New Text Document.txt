1st Standup:
What will you do today?
I will run the code to see if it works fine on my system, look at the flow of the code and will think about how to include add/delete resources feature in the code.

2nd Standup:
What did you do yesterday?
I setup my system by downgrading the java version to jdk 8. Because on jdk 19, javaFX was not supported. I also added the documents button to the existing interface.

What will you do today?
Today I will work on reading documents from the file system and enabling users to read the document.

Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
I did have a problem in setting up the code on my system, but I resolved it soon. So no impediments now.

3rd standup:
What did you do yesterday?
I was able to read the local storage so the users are now able to view the documents in the system.

What will you do today?
I will work on allowing user to add and delete resource.

Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
Yes, my system is only able to read text files yet, I am unable to read pdf, word, etc files yet.
